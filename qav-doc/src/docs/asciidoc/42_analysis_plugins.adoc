== Input Scope

QAvalidator works on _input scopes_ which define the system to analyze.

As of version 1.0, QAvalidator can read Java (`.class` files) and Maven POMs as input.

For all upcoming analysis steps, it is not relevant where the initial graph comes from. From then on, QAvalidator uses
nodes and edges, attributes on them (like types) etc. for its analysis.
All analysis is language-agnostic; apart from the `JavaQavPlugin` which reads `.class` files, there is nothing
Java-specific in QAvalidator.

One feature is that new languages may be added by implementing a new input scope reader.
More important is the fact that the _architecture model_ employed by QAvalidator is not language-specific.

== Creating and Working with Architecture Views on a Graph

An architecture view is a hierarchy of components above a certain input. It is a tree where the inner nodes are
architecture components, and the leaves are the elements of the input scope (see section <<qav-analysis-dsl-input-scope>>).

There may be an arbitrary number of architecture views on an input graph. Different architecture views are independent
from each other. See section <<qav-architecture-dsl-intro>> for a definition of an "architecture view".
